            Consultancy RFP :
     
            </h3>  
          
      <p class="customfont height">
          
          An agency seeking consulting services should prepare the RFP with great care. The RFP is at once the calling card, the resume, the annual report, and the marketing brochure of the agency. Consultants will decide whether to draft a proposal for a particular project based in significant part on the RFP. That RFP should present the community, the agency, and the proposed project accurately and well. Consultants pay a great deal of attention to the way their proposals are written because they have a lot on the line; agencies should pay equal attention to the writing of RFPs. Books and seminars on proposal writing are widely available. In comparison, the RFP is a neglected literary form.

            What the RFP Should Include :
     
            </h3>  
          
      <p class="customfont height">
          
          An RFP may be accompanied by appendices, maps, drawings, and other backup material. However, the RFP itself should be a relatively brief document. Even on a rather large or complex project, the various elements can generally be covered in 10 to 25 single-spaced pages.
          
      </p>
               
     <h4 class="customfont titlecompanys">Cover Sheet :</h4>   

       <p class="customfont height">
          
          A lengthy RFP should have a cover sheet giving the RFP title, the project or program title, the name of the issuing entity, and the date the proposal is due.
          
       </p>

      <h4 class="customfont titlecompanys">Introduction :</h4>   

       <p class="customfont height">
          
          The introduction should identify and describe, in no more than a paragraph, the project or program for which the consultant is required and its current status. It should then state briefly the nature of the consulting assistance being sought. This should be carefully worded. If the job requires an interdisciplinary team, it is best to talk about the end product or type of activity (e.g., an environmental impact assessment or a development plan), rather than a specific type of firm. Your preferences about the type of firm can be better explained later, in the qualifications section. The introduction should also state the amount budgeted for the proposed work. Finally, the due date for the proposal should also be included in the introduction, with a reference to the directions for submission that will be described later in the RFP.
          
       </p>

     <h4 class="customfont titlecompanys">Description of the Project or Program :</h4>

     <p class="customfont height">
         
         This section should establish the context for the work to be performed and help the consultant to judge the level of effort required for various tasks. If the project or program is very complex, the details can be relegated to an appendix or other attachments. The important points to cover here are:

           The Purpose of an RFP :
     
            </h3>  
          
      <p class="customfont height">
          
          Among the purposes of an RFP are eliciting proposals from suitable candidates and, when the RFP is not preceded by a review of qualifications, discouraging responses from those who lack the necessary qualifications. To that extent, the RFP resembles an ordinary help-wanted ad. However, since the audience for an RFP should be well screened in advance, these are not major concerns. A good RFP is, above all, one that engages the interest of the consultant and elicits creative approaches to the problem. Once the RFP has stimulated the consultant's interest, the firm is a lot more likely to risk investing in a proposal.
          
      </p>
    
     <p class="customfont height">
          
         A well-written RFP accurately conveys the full scope of the work desired, thereby enabling the consultant to address the project precisely and to make realistic cost estimates. In addition, the wording of an RFP should enable principals of a consulting firm to recognize whether the firm will be a serious contender for the job, thereby sparing the firm the expense of a useless proposal and sparing the agency the trouble of reading and responding to that proposal.
